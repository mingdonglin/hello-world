i forgot how to make a repository

The guide told me to write something about myself so here it is:
My favourite PC game: Don't Starve Together 
    I love wilson. He is cute.  Wilson dead hundreds of times because I was a noob at that time. 
    I play as Wigfrid most frequently. Beating boss makes me happy.

I also forgot how to write diary in English. Sigh.
